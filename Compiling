japkg can be build using the GNU make, GCC4.9.4 ( and possibly later).

The Makefile is currently set up for use with the RISC OS GCCSDK cross compiler on
a linux system.
To build use ro-make.

It should be adaptable to build natively under RISC OS with the above tools.
The include/library paths will need to be changed at least.

The libraries required are tbx and ziparch (ZipArchive).
