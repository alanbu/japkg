japkg is a command line utility to read a CSV list of packages and use the
information in it to produce RISC OS packages for RISC OS applications.

In it's current state it is hard coded for a particular use in automatically creating/updating
packages for the JASPP (The Archimedes Software Preservation Project).

The source is now provided in GitHub and can be used as an example of how multiple packages can be
created and managed.

Briefly, the catalogue/csv file it reads contains a list of column headings that are parsed
and used for identifying the fields in the following lines of the file.
These fields are used to set the various field for the package.

An additional folder called "Extras" contains special packages that also should be packaged,
but are not part of the CSV file.
The subfolders of Extras include the files to ship and Control and copyright files for the
package.

There is also a check to see if any of the files in a package have changed from the last package
created by japkg was and a new version of the package is created if they have.

This program just creates the packages. To turn this into a full package website an
index of the packages must be created. A program called pkgindex, available as part
of the RISC OS GCCSDK autobuilder, can be used for this additional step.
